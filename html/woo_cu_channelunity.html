        Please ensure that your ChannelUnity credentials are correctly entered in the ChannelUnity<br>
        tab on the Woocommerce->Settings page<br><br>
        
        Please also log into your ChannelUnity account to check your account status, and ensure any<br>
        outstanding invoices are cleared.<br><br>
        
        If you have recently cleared an invoice, it may take up to 30 minutes for the system to process.<br>
        
        Please wait a few moments, then click into the WooCommerce menu option. You can then click back into<br>
